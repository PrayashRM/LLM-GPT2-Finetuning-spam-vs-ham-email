# LLM-GPT2-Finetuning-spam-vs-ham-email
Demonstration of transfer learning for NLP. It involves implementing a GPT-2 (124M) model from scratch in PyTorch, loading its pre-trained weights, and then efficiently finetuning only the final transformer block to classify SMS messages as "spam" or "ham." It achieves an 95.67% test accuracy on a balanced version of the UCI SMS Spam dataset.
